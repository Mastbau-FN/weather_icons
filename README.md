**Note:** All of the icon data is auto-generated based on the latest release of [Weather Icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons/releases).

## Installation

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  weather_icons: 1.0.x # Use the latest version
```

## Usage

The library exposes all of the [Weather Icons](https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) as `IconData`. The naming convention is the same as the CSS names, minus the `wi-`, and all dashes replaced with underscores. It was named this way to match the default `Icons` class.

If you know which icon you need, you can use the provided constant icons. If you need a dynamic icon see below.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return IconButton(
      icon: Icon(WeatherIcons.day_sunny),
      onPressed: () {
          print("Foo");
      }
     );
  }
}
```

See [`weather_icons_g.dart`](https://github.com/worldturtlemedia/weather_icons/blob/master/lib/src/weather_icons_g.dart) for all of the icons.

### Dynamic

If you need a dynamic icon at run-time, then you can use the included helper function for converting from the CSS style name to a `IconData`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';

class WeatherDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  final String weatherCode;

  WeatherDisplay(this.weatherCode);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          Icon(
            WeatherIcons.fromString(
                weatherCode,
                // Fallback is optional, throws if not found, and not supplied.
                fallback: WeatherIcons.na
            ),
          ),
          Text("Icon for '$weatherCode'"),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Wind Direction

The wind icon is a special icon, as it is one single icon value that is then rotated using CSS. To achieve a similar functionality you can use the `WindIcon` class.

**Note:** This means that `WeatherIcons.wind` will always be the North facing icon.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';

class EastlyWindWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return IconButton(
      // Display a Wind icon facing towards east
      icon: WindIcon.towards_e,
      onPressed: () { ... }
     );
  }
}
```

Since the [Weather Icons](https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons) support both 'towards' and 'from' wind directions, this library does as well.

### Dynamic Wind Direction

Just like the weather above, if your wind direction is dynamic you can create your own `WindIcon`.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:weather_icons/weather_icons.dart';

class WindDirectionDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  final double windDirectionDegree;

  WindDirectionDisplay(this.windDirectionDegree);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container(
      child: Column(
        children: [
          WindIcon(angle: windDirectionDegree),
          Text("Icon for wind @ $windDirectionDegreeÂ°"),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Note:** The angle is in degrees of a compass/circle, so 0-360.
